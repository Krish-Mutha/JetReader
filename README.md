# Jet Reader

The “JetReader” project is an Android application designed to provide users
with a platform for managing their reading lists. With “JetReader”, users can
create an account, log in, and search for books that they can add to their
reading list. The application also provides users with the ability to rate the
books they have read and mark them as completed, which is then displayed on
their personal statistics screen.

## Technologies Employed:

In the development of this project, a range of cutting-edge technologies and tools were utilized to ensure a robust and efficient Android app. The following components played a pivotal role:

1. **Android Studio IDE:** The project leveraged Android Studio IDE for its comprehensive development and debugging capabilities, facilitating the creation of a seamless app.

2. **Kotlin Programming Language:** The Android app was predominantly crafted using the Kotlin programming language, known for its conciseness and expressive syntax, enabling efficient development.

3. **Jetpack Compose:** The app's user interface was constructed using Jetpack Compose, a modern UI toolkit. Its declarative approach simplified UI implementation and enhanced user experience.

4. **Firebase Authentication:** User authentication and management were seamlessly handled through Firebase Authentication, ensuring secure access to app features.

5. **Firebase Firestore:** To establish a robust cloud-based NoSQL database, Firebase Firestore was employed. It enabled the storage and retrieval of user data in a highly efficient manner.

6. **Google Books API:** Integration with the Google Books API provided the app with the capability to search for and retrieve comprehensive book information.

7. **Coil:** Coil, a proficient image loading and caching library, streamlined the process of loading images within the app, enhancing visual content delivery.

8. **Coroutines:** The project utilized Coroutines for effective asynchronous programming and concurrency management, resulting in smoother app performance.

9. **Retrofit:** Retrofit, a powerful networking library, facilitated seamless HTTP requests to the Google Books API, ensuring efficient communication between the app and external services.

10. **OkHttp:** As the HTTP client of choice, OkHttp played a vital role in making network requests to the Google Books API, contributing to reliable data retrieval.

11. **JSON Converter:** The integration of a JSON converter allowed effortless transformation of JSON data from the Google Books API into Kotlin objects, simplifying data handling within the app.

12. **Hilt:** Hilt, a Dependency Injection library, was instrumental in enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the Android app's codebase, streamlining the management of dependencies.

By amalgamating these advanced technologies, the project achieved a robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich Android app. The codebase's modularity and performance were heightened, resulting in a seamless user experience.
